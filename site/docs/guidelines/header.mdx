## To keep in mind

- Anatomy:
    - **Navigation bar:** Contains product switcher (between Engagement and Performance) or Culture Amp logo for customers with only 1 product.
    - **Title Block:** Contains the page title, breadcrumb, primary action, default action, secondary actions, and secondary navigation.
    - **Skirt:** Draws the user's eye into the content area. Contains the Filter Drawer, view/sort by functionality, and page [Search Field](/components/search-field).
- Variants:
    - **Default (Wisteria):** This is for most content and reporting pages. These pages let you consume data and take action.
    - **Education (Cluny):** This is for informative content, such as manager learning.
    - **Admin (White):** This is for administrative tasks. This header does not include a skirt.

### Navigation bar

Contains product switcher (between Engagement and Performance) or Culture Amp logo for customers with only 1 product. Contains primary wayfinding and links to key areas of the product.

### Title Block

Every Title Block includes:

- Page Title
- Breadcrumb
- Primary Action

A Title Block may include:

- Secondary navigation:
- Section title: 
- Primary action:
- Default action:
- Secondary actions:

If you need both section title and filter drawer, the filter drawer trumps the section title. The section title then lives inside the content area.

### Skirt

The skirt area may include Filter Drawer and Search.

There is no skirt in an Admin page.

#### First row

#### Second row
